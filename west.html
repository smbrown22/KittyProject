        <h3>The Tail of Golden Treats</h3>

        <p>With the last fleeting bits of sunlight, you decide to abandon the useless map you purchased. After all, it literally just points back to where you came. </p>
        <p>You continue on your path, the sun rapidly setting. The dirt path is soft beneath your feet. But suddenly, you feel a hard rock pressed against your paws. You investigate it, and find a golden rock! You dig around for more of the gold, but it seems this was the only rock. </p>
        <p>Oh well. Perhaps it is not the treasures youâ€™ve been told about, but perhaps there was other things you missed along the way? </p>

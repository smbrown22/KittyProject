        <p>You decide to not purchase anything, and turn to walk away. The bunny is quite angered by this, andâ€¦ smacks you on top of your head?! You quickly move to defend yourself with your claws, but it is no use, the bunny repeatedly jumps on your head until you are knocked out, cold. You fall into a deep sleep, unable to complete your journey.  </p>

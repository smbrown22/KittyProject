        <p>You decide on moving left. Surely treasure would be the way no cat would dare go. You light your lamp, and move along, the darkness not deterring you. You venture forth deeper into the woods, but stop as you hear a voice coming through the trees. “Can you please help me?” It cries. Do you investigate, or turn tail before whatever it is catches you?   </p>

        <h3>The Tail of Golden Treats</h3>
        <img src = fork-in-the-roads.png>
        <p>The elusive Furrest Grove, a place of mystery and magic. Legends tell of treats, hidden deep in the woods, of pure gold. Promised riches, to any kitty who dares to enter. No feline has ever made it out of the Furrest. You plan to be the first. </p>
        <p>Youâ€™ve been clawing your way through the woods for a few hours now, following the dirt path. You come across a fork in the road. The left looks dark and gloomy, trees blocking out the rapidly setting sun. Your enhanced vision not allowing you to peer through the darkness. You know if you travel this way, you will have to light your lamp, which only has fuel for a few hours. Do you light your lamp and carry on deeper into the woods? Or will you stay west with the setting sun?  </p>

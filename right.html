        <p>You decide your fortune may be best in the light. Becoming rich is not your only goal after all; you have to exit the woods with your riches. You move towards the light, but then hear a shrill voice greet you. “Hello Traveler! My, it’s truly been so long since we’ve had anyone down this path!”    </p>
        <p>“Take a look at my wares! Perhaps you may find something of interest?” </p>
        <p>You do have some spare change from buying your rations, perhaps the bunny’s dagger will keep you safe from danger? Or the map may lead you to your goal? Or maybe they’re both useless, and you should just save the coin for when you leave.  </p>

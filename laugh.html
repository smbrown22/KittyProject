        <p>You double over, laughing at this cat, who somehow, canâ€™t manage to climb down himself! You shake and roll around the ground, and furiously laugh for what seems to be hours on end. The cat in the tree tries to calm you down, but you ignore his pleas for help.  </p>
        <p>You pass out, unable to complete your journey, but you got a really good laugh out of it indeed. </p>
